Please analyze the code and add comments for each block (e.g., class definition, method definitions, loops, conditionals).
Rule: 
Each comment should describe the purpose of the block as a whole, rather than commenting on each individual line.
The goal is to provide a brief summary of what each block of code does.
**DO NOT fix or modify any syntax errors or formatting. Even if the code is invalid, keep it as-is.
ONLY return the updated code block with comments added, NO extra text.
